Future Improvements

- Add tests (Jasmine/PhantomJS)
- Improve UI (centered, better background, icons, fix table widths)
- Add fav-icon
- Add additional information dropdown for each city with remaining relevant weather information (this version only has what I consider the essentials of what people really check the weather for)
- Add browser check for local storage (right now it assumes you are running on a modern browser)
- move API key to local-config
- Better country handling
